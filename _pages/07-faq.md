## GENERAL

### What is Possible?
**Possible** is a non-profit organization that aims to build an effective healthcare system that integrates government hospitals and clinics with a network of community health workers to deliver high-quality healthcare from hospital to home in low-resource settings.

### What is NepalEHR?
NepalEHR is a tool that connects the various pieces of a healthcare system (facility-based care, community healthcare, logistics, administration, pharmacy, lab, etc) to ensure that clinicians and administrators have the information they need to provide the best care to their patients with the available resources. It is an integrated implementation of hospital-based (Bahmni), community-based (Commcare), and data visualization (DHIS2) tools configured to meet Nepal’s healthcare system needs.

### Where are the NepalEHR implementations?
Bayalpata Hospital, Achham, Nepal: Since February 2015
Charikot Hospital: Since 2016
Nuwakot Hospital (Potential)

### What is the difference between Bahmni and NepalEHR?
NepalEHR builds upon the strengths of Bahmni to integrate additional components (like Commcare and DHIS2) to create a more holistic healthcare system tool adapted to an Nepal’s healthcare system.

## IMPLEMENTATION

### What does it cost to implement NepalEHR?
Depending on multiple factors like size of facility, number of providers and range of services provided, the implementation size and costs can vary. The initial implementation costs at the 30-bed Charikot hospital was about $40K, including all hardware costs. Ongoing costs are much smaller as the bulk of the cost is capital expenditure.

### How do you deal with power issues in remote settings?
Due to unreliable power supply from the national grid, we ensure adequate power through use of solar panels and inverters.

### Will you need an expert to maintain it?
With some training, anyone with basic IT training can handle everyday issues at the remote sites - support for complex issues can be provided remotely by a central support team.

### Is the system secure?
NepalEHR’s underlying OpenMRS system uses industry standard protocols, and a role-based access control system. At the current implementations, the EHR is only accessible from the internet via secure VPN, as all implementations are setup in an internal network behind firewalls.
